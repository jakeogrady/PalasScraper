# PalasScraper
PalasScraper is a Web-Scraping Tool built using the Python Library Beautiful Soup to get movie info fast and efficient

## Motivation For Build
As much as I like the Palas Website, I would prefer if I could avoid using it and not have to go through Brave browser. This should cut that process out while helping me learn Python


## Roadmap
Future Ideas for tool include:
Using API to be able to access ratings and reviews of the movie from online e.g. from Letterboxd
